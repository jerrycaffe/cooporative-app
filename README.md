A web solution for staffs of the school to request for loan and access their savings account.
It is beleive that the president of the welfare group is the overall head of the community so therefore he has a managerial role
There are other elected members to oversee the daily and monthly running of the member of the community, so they are to be assigned the admin role
Members of the community are the target and they can view their personal accoount and therefore they are to be assigned the user role
According to these the web solution seek to establish three roles
1. Manager
2. Admin
3. User
